# The Problem
There are only a few radio streaming websites that are decent. A lot suffer from being terrible design or lacking features, some even having a pop up when you play a radio station.

# The Goal
To create an open-source radio streaming website that has real time comments for radio stations (similar to Twitch.tv) with ratings, sorting with a layout similar to imgur.com.

NOTE:

I will give instructions on how to set it up locally at some point if their is demand for this in the future but not right now, basically I use Azure for hosting with Azure storage and Azure databases and [Dirble](https://dirble.com/) for the radio's API.
